I made the Recommendation system based LLM and TwoTower model.
Input data was reduced in number of labels using dimensionality reduction and clustering before fine tuning in LLM
LLM.py: For finetuning with LoRA and QLoRA, Knowledge Distillation
LLM_gen.py: The synopsis data used by using this code
Clustering.py: For clustering pre-data
